# Functionalities

The role of `qosst-pp` is to provide a QOSST-compatible interface for error reconciliation and privacy amplification procedure from other packages.

In practice, it implements the necessary functions for Alice and Bob to 

* use the information reconciliation algorithm of [IR_for_CVQKD](https://github.com/erdemeray/IR_for_CVQKD);
* use the privacy amplification algorithm of [cryptomite](https://github.com/CQCL/cryptomite).
